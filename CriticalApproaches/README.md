## Critical Approaches to the News 

Over time, financial pressures at news outlets have made investigative reporting more difficult to finance. This is a reasonable hypothesis. 
It cannot be stated as an objective scientific fact without evidence to support it.This reality is a good reason to retain a note of scepticism for much 
of the opinion expressed on a typical op-ed page.

However, in one possible world with unlimited journalistic resources, empirical quantitative and qualitative evidence would 
be mustered to support op-ed pieces and also conclusions reached by 'experts' expressing their opinions in news articles, 
which is a pretty common form of editorializing that does exclude certain pontetially opposing voices.

The issue I wish to focus on initially here is scholarly publishing at the global level 
which is highly dependent on institutions and corporations from the United States and the West,
and thus given this dependence is worth more critical attention.

The aim is outline the issues and to model them computationally 
in Python in the spirit of [computational social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science)
(and also contemporary economics).  .
This sort of analysis, I feel, has the potential to add rigor to many sub-domains of social science, particularly in sociology. 

### MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute)

Currently, a controversy swirls around a commercial publishing
firm which has stepped into the academic publishing business in a big way,
MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute). 

['Publish or perish'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish) is a reality in universities around the world.

However, the supply of academic publishing opportunities is severely limited,
at least at publications that have a high ranking and a prestigious, respected name,
tus providing standards and norms of academic achievement. 

MDPI has grown very quickly: 

"MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute) is a publisher of open access scientific journals. 
Founded by Shu-Kun Lin as a chemical sample archive, it now publishes over 390 peer-reviewed, open access journals. 
MDPI is among the largest publishers in the world in terms of journal article output, 
and is the largest publisher of open access articles. 
Between 2016-2020, the number of peer-reviewed papers published by MDPI grew significantly, 
with year over year growth of over 50% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, 
attracting attention to their very fast article processing times."

- [Article Processing Charges (APCs) and the new enclosure of research - August 11th, 2022](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/08/11/article-processing-charges-apcs-and-the-new-enclosure-of-research/) 

"In 2020 we estimate the annual revenues from article processing charges (APCs) among major scholarly journal publishers to have exceeded 2 billion US dollars. Alongside these revenues, a pattern of mergers and takeovers in the industry indicate that publishers find APCs to be an even more profitable business model than subscriptions. This has significant implications for research and researchers, as researchers who cannot make their country, institution or project pay are not able to fulfil their research, ultimately closing access to research." 

- [There is no black and white definition of predatory publishing](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2020/05/13/there-is-no-black-and-white-definition-of-predatory-publishing/) 

"A key feature of many open access business models is the Article Processing Charge (APC). Whereby, publishers instead of receiving flat subscription fees, are remunerated for each published article. This provides a ‘predatory’ incentive for less scrupulous publishers to publish articles quickly and without appropriate quality control, as, after all, rejected articles consume publisher resources but yield no revenue. 

"High fees in eminent journals may be criticised, but they would never be labelled as ‘predatory’, even if their business models may be economically exploitative.

"This ‘predatory’ incentive structure is also uniquely ascribed to low and middle-status OA journals. In contrast, prestigious OA publishers and journals enjoy the benefit of having selectivity positively associated with value. High rejection rates, if not always quality, imbue prestigious journals and publishers with pricing power. As such, high fees in eminent journals may be criticised, but they would never be labelled as ‘predatory’, even if their business models may be economically exploitative.

"That definitions of predatory publishing have a subjective element is made clear by observing that economic exploitation can also exist in other business models. For example, the “big deal” subscriptions that lock universities into paying for journals that are seldom used.



### My critical comment: 

At least it is slowly breaking the big corporation publisher monopoly 
that is bankrupting university libraries in times of declining enrollment 
and financial viability for all but the highest tier universities, 
and it is a publish or perish mentality that drives this which 
may not even be relevant at lowest tier where teaching maybe should focus more on vocational business and work relevant skills, 
all of which can result in publications but of an essentially different nature that complements R1 university research....
