## Critical Approaches to the News 

Over time, financial pressures at news outlets have made investigative reporting more difficult to finance. This is a reasonable hypothesis. 
It cannot be stated as an objective scientific fact without evidence to support it.This reality is a good reason to retain a note of scepticism for much 
of the opinion expressed on a typical op-ed page.

However, in one possible world with unlimited journalistic resources, empirical quantitative and qualitative evidence would 
be mustered to support op-ed pieces and also conclusions reached by 'experts' expressing their opinions in news articles, 
which is a pretty common form of editorializing that does exclude certain pontetially opposing voices.

The issue I wish to focus on initially here is scholarly publishing at the global level 
which is highly dependent on institutions and corporations from the United States and the West,
and thus given this dependence is worth more critical attention.

The aim is outline the issues and to model them computationally 
in Python in the spirit of [computational social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science)
(and also contemporary economics).  .
This sort of analysis, I feel, has the potential to add rigor to many sub-domains of social science, particularly in sociology. 

### MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute)

Currently, a controversy swirls around a commercial publishing
firm which has stepped into the academic publishing business in a big way,
MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute). 

['Publish or perish'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish) is a reality in universities around the world.

However, the supply of academic publishing opportunities is severely limited,
at least at publications that have a high ranking and a prestigious, respected name,
tus providing standards and norms of academic achievement. 

MDPI has grown very quickly: 

"MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute) is a publisher of open access scientific journals. 
Founded by Shu-Kun Lin as a chemical sample archive, it now publishes over 390 peer-reviewed, open access journals. 
MDPI is among the largest publishers in the world in terms of journal article output, 
and is the largest publisher of open access articles. 
Between 2016-2020, the number of peer-reviewed papers published by MDPI grew significantly, 
with year over year growth of over 50% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, 
attracting attention to their very fast article processing times."
(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDPI))

MDPI has a business model that addresses the needs of academics working under 'publish or perish' conditions 
in universities around the world:

"MDPI's business model is based on establishing entirely open access broad-discipline journals, with fast processing times from submission to publication and article processing charges paid by the author. MDPI's business practices have attracted controversy, with critics suggesting it sacrifices editorial and academic rigor in favor of operational speed and business interests. MDPI was included on Jeffrey Beall's list of predatory open access publishing companies in 2014 but was removed in 2015 following a successful appeal while applying pressure on Beall's employer. Some journals published by MDPI have also been noted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Norwegian Scientific Publication Register, two major scientific bodies, for lack of rigour and possible predatory practice." (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDPI))
 
 These issues have notably been addressed by insightful blog postings at the London School of Economics:

- [Article Processing Charges (APCs) and the new enclosure of research - August 11th, 2022](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/08/11/article-processing-charges-apcs-and-the-new-enclosure-of-research/) 

"In 2020 we estimate the annual revenues from article processing charges (APCs) among major scholarly journal publishers to have exceeded 2 billion US dollars. Alongside these revenues, a pattern of mergers and takeovers in the industry indicate that publishers find APCs to be an even more profitable business model than subscriptions. This has significant implications for research and researchers, as researchers who cannot make their country, institution or project pay are not able to fulfil their research, ultimately closing access to research." 

- [There is no black and white definition of predatory publishing - May 13th, 2020](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2020/05/13/there-is-no-black-and-white-definition-of-predatory-publishing/) 

"A key feature of many open access business models is the Article Processing Charge (APC). Whereby, publishers instead of receiving flat subscription fees, are remunerated for each published article. This provides a ‘predatory’ incentive for less scrupulous publishers to publish articles quickly and without appropriate quality control, as, after all, rejected articles consume publisher resources but yield no revenue. 

"High fees in eminent journals may be criticised, but they would never be labelled as ‘predatory’, even if their business models may be economically exploitative.

"This ‘predatory’ incentive structure is also uniquely ascribed to low and middle-status OA journals. In contrast, prestigious OA publishers and journals enjoy the benefit of having selectivity positively associated with value. High rejection rates, if not always quality, imbue prestigious journals and publishers with pricing power. As such, high fees in eminent journals may be criticised, but they would never be labelled as ‘predatory’, even if their business models may be economically exploitative.

"That definitions of predatory publishing have a subjective element is made clear by observing that economic exploitation can also exist in other business models. For example, the “big deal” subscriptions that lock universities into paying for journals that are seldom used.

The situation is surely to get more intense and complicated with the recent advent of AI-writing aids:

### Communities of Scholarship

Science began in communities of scientists exchanging ideas in small societies such as the royal society, 
of which Isaac Newton served as a president and Robert Boyle was an early member: 

"The Royal Society... Founded on 28 November 1660 [362 years ago], it was granted a royal charter by King Charles II as The Royal Society and is the oldest continuously existing scientific academy in the world." (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society))

This relatively ancient form of scholarly exchange might be well-suited to many contexts of science and scholarship today. 
This might include graduate student publication and publication in small limited disciplines that cannot even support 
academic journals run by publishers. 

The discipline or scholarly focus of pre-modern Burmese and Southeast Asian history
that I have actively published in, is arguably of this type, with scholars having to search for possibly related journals to publish in,
and almost no conceivable opportunities for scholars actually living locally in the country under study.

However, the [SOAS Bulletin of Burma Research (SBBR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAS_Bulletin_of_Burma_Research)
for a time provided a community of scholars with a platform to publish on. 

The once open-access journal that claims to be the premier journal in the field is now firmly ensconced behind a paywall making it inaccessible 
to the people of Burma, the subject of its research. 

**Journal of Burma Studies**

"The Journal of Burma Studies is the premier peer-reviewed academic print journal that focuses exclusively on Burma. The Journal of Burma Studies is jointly sponsored by the Burma Studies Group and the Center for Burma Studies at Northern Illinois University. It is published twice a year by the Center for Burma Studies. The Journal seeks to publish the best scholarly research focused on Burma/Myanmar, its ethnic nationality, stateless and diasporic cultures from a variety of disciplines, ranging from art history and religious studies, to economics and law. Published since 1997, it draws together research and critical reflection on Burma/Myanmar from scholars around the world." (Source: [Website](https://jbs.scholasticahq.com/))

The [publisher is allegedly the University of Hawaii](https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/jbs/), however when I was at the University of Hawaii as a graduate student
I actually had to use interlibrary loan to access some issues.

Here is another bold declaration of exclusivity from the paywall site that excludes global access: 

"The Journal of Burma Studies is one of the only scholarly peer-reviewed printed journal exclusively on Burma. The Journal of Burma Studies is jointly sponsored by the Burma Studies Group and the Center for Burma Studies at Northern Illinois University. The Journal seeks to publish the best scholarly research focused on Burma/Myanmar and its minority and diasporic cultures from a variety of disciplines, ranging from art history and religious studies, to economics and law. Published since 1997, it draws together research and critical reflection on Burma/Myanmar from scholars across Asia, North America and Europe."

### My critical comments: 

1. At least it [MDPI] is slowly breaking the big corporation publisher monopoly 
that is bankrupting university libraries in times of declining enrollment 
and financial viability for all but the highest tier universities, 
and it is a publish or perish mentality that drives this which 
may not even be relevant at lowest tier where teaching maybe should focus more on vocational business and work relevant skills, 
all of which can result in publications but of an essentially different nature that complements R1 university research....

2. "I'm a PhD student. My supervisors push me to publish in a journal whose editor is one of my supervisors. It's not in "fascia A", I don't know in English, maybe Italian members can translate for me. So I don't know, is it worth to publish there and why?"

"Sounds like a good face-to-face research-community building move, science began with communities of scientists sharing ideas in, the 'royal society' in Great Britain for example, not hyper-modernized web-based anonymity, and PhD students don't necessarily publish in academic journals anyway, some arguing that this is premature and inadvisable."
