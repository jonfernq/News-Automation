## Spacy NLP

Spacy is an open-source software library for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in Python. Here are some things that Spacy can do:

1. **Tokenization:** It can split text into words, punctuation, and other meaningful elements called "tokens."

2. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** It can assign each word in a sentence its corresponding grammatical part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb, or preposition.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** It can identify and label named entities in text, such as people, organizations, locations, and product names.

4. **Dependency Parsing:** It can analyze the grammatical structure of a sentence to determine how words relate to each other.

5. **Lemmatization:** It can determine the base form of a word (lemma) so that words with different inflections can be recognized as the same word.

6. **Sentence Boundary Detection:** It can identify sentence boundaries in text.

7. **Text Classification:** It can classify text into pre-defined categories based on its content.

8. **Word Vector Representations:** It can create high-quality word embeddings, which are numerical representations of words that capture their meaning and semantic relationships with other words.

Overall, Spacy provides a powerful and efficient toolkit for various NLP tasks, making it a popular choice for researchers and developers working on natural language processing projects.
