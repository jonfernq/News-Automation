## Thai Interlinear Translation 

Inserting the English definitions after the Thai words of a Thai text is one form of interlinear translation.
This sort of translation helps language learners read texts in the language they are learning.
It saves them the time of looking up words in the dictionary. 

An interlinear translation or gloss is defined more precisely as follows: 

"In linguistics and pedagogy, an interlinear gloss is a gloss 
(series of brief explanations, such as definitions or pronunciations) placed between lines, 
such as between a line of original text and its translation into another language. 
When glossed, each line of the original text acquires one or more corresponding lines 
of transcription known as an interlinear text or interlinear glossed text (IGT)â€”
interlinear for short. Such glosses help the reader follow the relationship between 
the source text and its translation, and the structure of the original language. 
In its simplest form, an interlinear gloss is simply a literal, word-for-word translation of the source text."
